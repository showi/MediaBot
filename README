0.0.3 2011/07.30 Major improvement on IRC::BotCmdPlus system (Alpha version) - <joachim {dot} basmaison {at} gmail {dot} com>
----------------
- Much cleaner interface when calling command on plug-in, so we have less coding on the plug-in side.
- Plug-in register command automatically. Each plug-in can register 'n' commands along with lvl, type of access (public, private), and description for automatic help.
- All plugin use the POE::Component::IRC::Plugin. They can register event, but command are called by IRC::Plugins::Dispatch.
- Help plugin who introduce !help command and list all available command.
- User login support
- Channel creation support
- Adding user support
